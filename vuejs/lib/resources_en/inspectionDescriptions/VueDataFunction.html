  This inspection warns if <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#data">data</a> property of Vue component is not a function.
  <p>When defining a component, <code>data</code> must be declared as a function that returns the initial data object, because there will be many instances created using the same definition. If we still use a plain object for <code>data</code>, that same object will be shared by reference across all instances created! By providing a <code>data</code> function, every time a new instance is created, we can simply call it to return a fresh copy of the initial data.
